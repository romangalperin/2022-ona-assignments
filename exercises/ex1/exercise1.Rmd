```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
#setwd("~/dev/teaching/2022-ona/2022-ona-assignments/")
```

## 2. Loading data

```{r}
connections <- read_csv("Connections.csv")
```

## 3. Get count of contacts by employer
I'm using `dplyr` functions ("verbs") to do the counts. Also note the pipe operator `%>%` that passes the data from one step to the next.

```{r}
connections %>% 
  count(Company) %>% 
  arrange(-n)
```
